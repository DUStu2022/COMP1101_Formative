Review from Group 1
====================

i. Interest of content ***Sound***
-----------------------------------
The content itself was good, and interesting. However, we felt that there was not enough of it and perhaps more time could have been spent goig a little deeper.

ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation ***Exemplary***
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We think the site looks very consistent on the whole - however, some of the alignments are different on different pages.

iii. Quality of written presentation ***Perfect***
---------------------------------------------------
We think that the content and quality of writing is really good!

iv. Validity of HTML ***Perfect***
-----------------------------------
The HTML is valid, and exemplifies good practice.

v. Evidence of author collaboration ***Perfect***
--------------------------------------------------
There is good evidence of author collaboration through GitHub issues. Largely a team effort. The bulk of the page was committed in good time for the assignment's submission.
