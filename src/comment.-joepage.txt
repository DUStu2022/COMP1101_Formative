Comment from Ariel:
        Very good.
        The concept of screen readers is quite interesting and useful.
        The font and format of text and images still need some adjustments.
        There need to be some blank place and gap to make the whole page more readable.
        The pictures need to be nto so large.
        The presentation is direct and proper.
        The new kind of screen reader may include more information.
        HTML can run successfully without mistakes.
        The pictures are cited with references.
