        <p>VOIP is a group of technologies for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over the internet. First deployed in 1981 by <a href='http://www.speakfreely.org/history.html' target="_blank">Brian C Wiles</a> to allow video game players to talk over ethernet connections through his RASCAL software, it has truly gained prominence during the Covid lockdowns of 2020 and 2021</p>

            During the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, most office work was conducted from home and in this space landlines were not appropriate as 
            they were not optimised for meetings where there were more than 2 attendees/locations. VOIP was the perfect solution as it allowed
            for multiple people to be connected to a call at the same time and for the call to be recorded for later use. 
        </p>
        <p> The popularity of VOIP during these lockdowns can be reflected in the share price of companies offering office VOIP systems
            most notably Zoom Video Communications Inc. (ZM) which saw its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM/">share price</a> explode by 1,500% in 2020 (559.09USD compared to an IPO of 36USD per share)

        <p>
            In the aftermath of the pandemic, many companies have decided to continue with remote working and have therefore continued to use VOIP
            to conduct meetings and calls. This has led to a continued increase in the popularity of VOIP and has led to the creation of new companies
            offering VOIP services. A trend that is likely to continue as the world continues to adapt to the new normal.
